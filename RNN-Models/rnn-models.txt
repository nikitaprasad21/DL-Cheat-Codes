Summary of RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and deep RNNs in one line each:

* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Basic neural network architecture with connections between units forming directed cycles, suitable for sequential data processing.
* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: RNN architecture with specialized memory cells and gating mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies more effectively.
* Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs): Simplified RNN variant with fewer parameters than LSTMs, featuring update and reset gates to control information flow.
* Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Extension of RNN architecture with multiple recurrent layers stacked hierarchically, allowing for learning complex hierarchical representations of sequential data.
